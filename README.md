# SortingProject
This project includes several sorting algorithms, such as Timsort, Introspective Sort, Heapsort, and Dual-Pivot Quicksort. Additionally, arrays of sizes 1 000, 10 000, 50 000, 100 000, 500 000, and 1 000 000 are randomly generated for benchmarking.

Sorting experiments are conducted on randomly generated arrays of the specified sizes under the following conditions:
1. Fully random elements - The entire array consists of randomly generated elements.
2. Partially sorted arrays - The first 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, 99.7%, and 100% of the elements are already sorted.
3. Reverse sorted arrays - The array is completely sorted but in descending order.

To ensure accuracy, each sorting algorithm is tested multiple times per array size. 100 measurements per size made to obtain statistically significant results.
